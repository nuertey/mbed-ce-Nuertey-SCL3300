# Nuertey-SCL3300-Mbed - Type-Driven SPI Framing Protocol For Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd.'s SCL3300 3-Axis Inclinometer.

SCL3300 - 3-axis inclinometer with angle output and digital SPI interface. 

This sensor driver is targetted for the ARM Mbed platform. For ease of use, power, flexibility and readability of the code, the protocol has been written in a modern C++ (C++17/C++20) metaprogrammed and templatized class-encapsulated idiom. 

A goal of the design is to encourage and promote zero-cost abstractions, even and especially so, in the embedded realms. Note that care has been taken to deduce and glean those abstractions from the problem-domain itself. And in the doing so, care has also been taken to shape the abstractions logically.

The SCL3300 is targeted at applications demanding high stability and accuracy with tough environmental requirements. Typical applications would include:
 
  - Leveling
  - Tilt sensing
  - Machine control
  - Structural health monitoring
  - Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
  - Robotics
  - Positioning and guidance system
 
Key features of the sensor are as follows:
 
  - 3-axis (XYZ) inclinometer
  - User selectable measurement modes:
    - 3000 LSB/g with 70 Hz LPF
    - 6000 LSB/g with 40 Hz LPF
    - 12000 LSB/g with 10 Hz LPF
  - Angle output resolution 0.0055°/LSB
  - −40°C…+125°C operating range
  - 3.0V…3.6V supply voltage
  - SPI digital interface
  - Ultra-low 0.001 °/√Hz noise density
  - Excellent offset stability
  - Size 8.6 x 7.6 x 3.3 mm (l × w × h)
  - Proven capacitive 3D-MEMS technology

## Tested Target (and Peripheral):

Lacking an actual SCL3300 sensor on my workbench for testing, I am left to appeal to you OEMs or better-equipped IoT hobbyists out there. If you have a spare SCL3300 dev board that can be connected to my STM32F767-ZI [Nucleo-144], kindly send me an email at nuertey_odzeyem@hotmail.com
